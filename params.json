The Kinect will collect novel telemetry of human performance to direct future research.\r\n\r\nSince this video, I've added additional settings and collecting more data, but it gives you an idea. :)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLDbcNBgMU8\r\n\r\n## Documents\r\n\r\n- [Review of Literature](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60537438/TheoryC/Sara%20Ford%20Review%20of%20Literature%20Kin298%20Project%20Final.docx)\r\n- [Technical Overview of TheoryC Software](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60537438/TheoryC/Technical%20overview%20of%20the%20TheoryC%20software.docx)\r\n- [Poster from Project Day](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/60537438/TheoryC/Sara%20Ford%20TheoryC%20Poster%20Final.pptx)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
